# English Learning Application

A client-server application for learning English, built with modern C++17. The system provides interactive lessons, tests, exercises, vocabulary games, and real-time chat between students and teachers. Designed with clean architecture principles, the codebase is modular, testable, and extensible.

### Design Rationale

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Upper layers depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.
- **Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation by mocking repository interfaces.
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added by implementing existing interfaces without modifying core logic.
- **Protocol Independence**: The protocol layer can be replaced (e.g., switch from JSON to Protocol Buffers) without affecting business logic.

### Real-Time Chat

The chat system supports:

- Sending messages with delivery confirmation
- Receiving push notifications for new messages
- Chat history persistence during session

---

## Development Notes

### Coding Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **DRY**: Common utilities extracted to shared headers

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Define the domain model** in `include/core/`
2. **Create the repository interface** in `include/repository/`
3. **Implement the repository** in `src/repository/memory/`
4. **Create the service interface** in `include/service/`
5. **Implement the service** in `src/service/`
6. **Add protocol messages** in `include/protocol/message_types.h`
7. **Add request handlers** in `server.cpp`
8. **Update clients** to use the new feature

### Adding a New Protocol Message

1. Add message type constants to `include/protocol/message_types.h`:

```cpp
constexpr const char* MY_FEATURE_REQUEST = "MY_FEATURE_REQUEST";
constexpr const char* MY_FEATURE_RESPONSE = "MY_FEATURE_RESPONSE";
```

2. Add handler in `server.cpp`:

```cpp
else if (messageType == MessageType::MY_FEATURE_REQUEST) {
    response = handleMyFeatureRequest(payload, sessionToken);
}
```

3. Implement handler function following existing patterns.

4. Update client to send request and handle response.

### Namespace Organization

```cpp
english_learning::core::        // Domain models
english_learning::protocol::    // Protocol utilities
english_learning::repository::  // Data access
english_learning::service::     // Business logic
```

---

## Security Notes

### Password Handling

- Passwords are currently stored in plaintext in memory
- Production deployment should implement password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- Passwords are transmitted in JSON payloads (use TLS in production)

### Session Management

- 64-character alphanumeric session tokens
- Tokens expire after 1 hour of inactivity
- Tokens are validated on every authenticated request
- Socket-to-session mapping for push notifications

### Known Limitations

- No TLS/SSL encryption (plaintext TCP)
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- No input sanitization for SQL injection (N/A with in-memory storage)
- Session tokens stored in memory only

### Recommendations for Production

- Implement TLS encryption for all communications
- Add password hashing before storage
- Implement rate limiting and account lockout
- Add request validation and sanitization
- Use persistent storage with proper access controls
